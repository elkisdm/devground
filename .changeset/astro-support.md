Add Astro support across the toolkit.

- `@devground/eslint-config` exposes a new `/astro` entry that wires `eslint-plugin-astro`'s recommended flat config. `eslint-plugin-astro` is declared as an optional peer dependency.
- `@devground/tsconfig` ships two new presets: `astro.json` (dev, extends `astro/tsconfigs/strict`) and `astro-typecheck.json` (CI, disables `incremental`). `astro` is declared as an optional peer dependency.
- `devground-init` (CLI) detects Astro projects (presence of `astro` in dependencies, after Next.js and before React) and installs the matching ESLint and TSConfig presets automatically, including a `tsconfig.typecheck.json` variant.
- `@devground/devground` (meta `devground-setup`) mirrors the same Astro detection and writes the same configs.

Detection precedence is now `next > astro > react > node`. Astro wins over React because any React component inside an Astro project runs as an island, so the Astro preset is the correct umbrella in that case.
